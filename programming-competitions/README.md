### What is competitive programming?

Write your own algorithms to solve problems given to you. We'll be using problems from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). Make sure you sign up for an account!

We can also use [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java)(only for Java and Python), and [Edabit](https://codingbat.com/java) among others.
