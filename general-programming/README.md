# General programming

### What is general programming?

Here you'll find lots of problem solving, algorithms, and miscellaneous programs here.

---

### Pick a language:

1. Java - Most reccomended, it'll give you a good foundation for programming. Be up for a good challenge.
2. Python - More simple to learn and very versatile.
3. C# - Like Java but a little different.
4. JavaScript - Different from the rest but very versatile. Reccomeneded if you're also interested in web development.

Not sure which one you should pick? Ask me which one I would reccomend for you!

### Tutorials:

These are only a couple tutorials. Feel free to search up tutorials for your selected language as well. Learning to program isn't easy. It takes time and dedication, the important part is that you stick with it! Please reach out if you have any questions or would like tutorial recommendations.

### What can you do?

-   Build small programs like calculators, calenders, todo lists etc. If you're having trouble of thinking of a program you want to make search up beginner projects for your selected language. For example, "Java beginner projects" and try to do some of those on your own.

-   Challenge yourself by creating algorithms to solve problems. Here're some sites:
