**Bulid your own projects and get very confortable with these technologies before continuing. Especially JavaScript!!**

You've now got a solid understanding of web development you will need to follow the path you chose earlier. It's best that you follow 1-2 tutorials that explain theory for the technologies a part of the path you are learning. Then a few more that build-along project tutorials. Afterwards start making your own projects to get some experience!
