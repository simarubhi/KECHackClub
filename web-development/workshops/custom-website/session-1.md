# Wireframing

Desiging a website, no matter how complex or simple can get confusing quick. For that reason, planning out your website is very important. Web designers and developers often start with a "wireframe" so they can plan out what their website will look like.

A wire frame is not the complete design, but rather a template of what each part of the website will have content wise. For example, where images will go, where icons will go, where buttons will go, what sections and pages you'll have, etc.

For this week, start by thinking of an idea for what kind of website you'd like to make. Once you have an idea, it's time to start creating a wireframe. Watch this video for a quick tutorial on how to make a wireframe https://youtu.be/qpH7-KFWZRI. If you're stuck, try going to website that are similar to your idea and look at how they have everything laid out. Rember this isn't the final design and it doesn't have to be perfect!

As always let me know if you have any questions!
