1. **Basic HTML Pages 1-4**

2. **[Go through all of the HTML pages, don't worry about:](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp)**
    - Tables
    - Iframes
    - Computer Code
    - Entities
    - URL Encode
    - HTML vs. XHTML
    
    They are more advanced topics and may take some time to understand.
    
3. **[CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)**
    - In the first section cover everything except for:
        - Tables
        - Float
        - Image Gallery
        - Image Sprites
        
    - In the advanced section cover flexbox.
    
    - The rest of the topics should only be explored when you're more comfortable with CSS.
        
    - CSS takes a long time to learn, practise on your own to become comfortable using it!
